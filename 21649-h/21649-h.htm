PREFACE
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
If the existence and contents of this book require any explanation, the compiler may adopt the words of a famous defender of poetry:
</em>
</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p>
<em>
&#34;Hee doth not onely shew the way but giveth so sweet a prospect into the way as will entice anie man into it.
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
&#34;Nay, hee doth as if your journey should lye through a faire Vineyard, at the verie first give you a cluster of Grapes that full of that taste you may long to passe further. He beginneth not with obscure definitions, which must blurre the margent with interpretations and loade the memorie with doubtfulnesse, but hee cometh to you with words set in delightful proportion, either accompanied with or prepared for the well-enchanting skill of musicke, and with a tale forsoothe he cometh unto you, with a tale which holdeth children from play and olde men from the chimney-corner, and pretending no more, doth intend the winning of the minde from wickedness to vertue.&#34;
</em>
</p>
</div>
<p>
<em>
These excellent words of Sir Philip Sidney give the reason and scope of this collection of examples of the poetry of the present century. No attempt at arbitrary classification or labelling has been made; it is not intended to show that any poet, deliberately or otherwise, is a Neo-Symbolist or Paroxyst or is afflicted with any other 'ist or 'ism; it is not compiled to assert that any one group of poets is superior to any other group of poets or to poets who had the misfortune to have their corporeal existence cut short before the dawn of the twentieth century; it is not even intended to prove that good poetry is written in our time. All such purposes and particularly the latter are superfluous and may be left to dogmatic disputants who have little care for the grace and harmony of poetry.
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
The scheme of the Anthology is simple and without guile. It does not presuppose an abrupt period, but for the sake of convenience and in justification of its existence includes only the work of living writers produced during the present century and therefore most likely to be representative of the poetry of to-day. No editorial credit can be claimed for the selections; they are not the reflex of one individual's taste and preferences, but have been made by the writers themselves, to whom&#8212;and their respective publishers&#8212;for their cordial co-operation the collator of this distinctive volume is exceedingly grateful, not on his own account only but also on behalf of those readers to whom this volume will open out so fair a prospect that they will long to pass further, this &#34;cluster of grapes&#34; being one of the &#34;lures immortal&#34; for the rapidly increasing number of discriminating lovers of the high poetry that is the touchstone of beauty. The finest lyric work of our day needs no further introduction; the poet is his own best interpreter; but it may be added, in anticipation of adventitious criticism of the limitations of these examples, that the capacity of the present volume and the absence abroad of some potential contributors account for the non-inclusion of certain writers who otherwise would have been represented here.

BABYLON
</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>
The blue dusk ran between the streets: my love was winged within my mind,
</p>
<p>
It left to-day and yesterday and thrice a thousand years behind.
</p>
<p>
To-day was past and dead for me, for from to-day my feet had run
</p>
<p>
Through thrice a thousand years to walk the ways of ancient Babylon.
</p>
<p>
On temple top and palace roof the burnished gold flung back the rays
</p>
<p>
Of a red sunset that was dead and lost beyond a million days.
</p>
<p>
The tower of heaven turns darker blue, a starry sparkle now begins;
</p>
<p>
The mystery and magnificence, the myriad beauty and the sins
</p>
<p>
Come back to me. I walk beneath the shadowy multitude of towers;
</p>
<p>
Within the gloom the fountain jets its pallid mist in lily flowers.
</p>
<p>
The waters lull me and the scent of many gardens, and I hear
</p>
<p>
Familiar voices, and the voice I love is whispering in my ear.
</p>
<p>
Oh real as in dream all this; and then a hand on mine is laid:
</p>
<p>
The wave of phantom time withdraws; and that young Babylonian maid,
</p>
<p>
One drop of beauty left behind from all the flowing of that tide,
</p>
<p>
Is looking with the self-same eyes, and here in Ireland by my side.
</p>
<p>
Oh light our life in Babylon, but Babylon has taken wings,
</p>
<p>
While we are in the calm and proud procession of eternal things.

And lives and knows herself again.

He, in his dreaming under the sun,

Saw change and the unchanging One,

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Nought is there here the eye to strike&#8212;
</p>
<p class="i4">
Uncurved canals where barges ply;
</p>
<p>
A hundred hamlets all alike;
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i4">
Flat fields that cut an arc of sky
</p>
<p>
With men and women o'er them bent
</p>
<p class="i4">
Who needs must labour lest they die.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Would any say that lives so spent
</p>
<p class="i4">
Might break, spurred on by love and pride,
</p>
<p>
Their bars of animal content?
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i4">
Nay, here live men unvexed, untried&#8212;
</p>
<p>
I mused. Yet pacing Roosevelt street
</p>
<p class="i4">
In idle humour I espied
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
A village man and woman meet,
</p>
<p class="i4">
And pass with never word or sign&#8212;
</p>
<p>
So strange in neighbour-folk whose feet
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i4">
Haunt the same fields in rain and shine
</p>
<p>
That, curious eyed, in either face,
</p>
<p class="i4">
In curve of lip, or graven line,
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
I sought for hints of pain or trace
</p>
<p class="i4">
Of harsh resolve, and so grew ware
</p>
<p>
That hers was as a hiding place
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i4">
Where lurked the kinship of despair;
</p>
<p>
While his bore record deeply wrought
</p>
<p class="i4">
That life for him had but one care,
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
And that&#8212;to mesh re-iterant thought
</p>
<p class="i4">
In labour, till at last his soul
</p>
<p>
Should find the anodyne it sought.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i4">
Hence now with dreary face he stole
</p>
<p>
Through Roosevelt Street, nor stretched his hand
</p>
<p class="i4">
To beg from life its smallest dole.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
And yet these two had loved and planned
</p>
<p class="i4">
To happiest end, but for the flood
</p>
<p>
That wrecks, upreared on rock or sand,
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i4">
The house of hopes. Thus&#8212;cold of mood,
</p>
<p>
He, loving wholly, could but choose
</p>
<p class="i4">
To deem her heart as his subdued;
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
While she, as maidens oft-times use,
</p>
<p class="i4">
Denied sweet proofs of love, was fain
</p>
<p>
To gain them by the world-old ruse;
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i4">
And failing, vexed to find that vain
</p>
<p>
Was all her pretty reticence,
</p>
<p class="i4">
She happed upon a worthless swain
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
On whom, reserved the gold, the pence
</p>
<p class="i4">
Of liberal smiles she flung away,
</p>
<p>
Till, snared by her own innocence,
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i4">
She fell&#8212;Ah, God! how far that day
</p>
<p>
She fell&#8212;from hope and promise plumb,
</p>
<p class="i4">
To deeps where lips forget to pray.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
But he, apart, with sorrow dumb,
</p>
<p class="i4">
Beheld, scarce conscious of the strife,
</p>
<p>
Himself in her by fate o'ercome;
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i4">
And as she passed to her new life,
</p>
<p>
Righted by still more wrong, divined
</p>
<p class="i4">
Her hate for him who called her wife,
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
And on the hoarded knowledge pined
</p>
<p class="i4">
And starved, till he, as she, was dead,
</p>
<p>
And nought remained but to unwind
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i4">
His coil of days. So with slow tread
</p>
<p>
He goes his way through Roosevelt Street
</p>
<p class="i4">
At night and morn, nor turns his head
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
When past him comes the sound of feet&#8212;
</p>
<p class="i4">
Of ghostly feet that long ago
</p>
<p>
In life had made his pulses beat.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i4">
For, mark you, both are dead, and so
</p>
<p>
Small wonder is it nought should pass
</p>
<p class="i4">
Betwixt them in the street, I trow.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Yet still they move with that huge mass

<p class="i4">
Of life unpurposeful that reaps
</p>
<p>
The corn in season, mows the grass,
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i4">
And then by right of labour sleeps
</p>
<p>
With privilege of dreams that ape

<p class="i4">
Fulfilment, whereby each may creep

</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
From pain through doors of dear escape;

Save such, unhappy, as would win

Some respite for themselves, and shape

<div class="stanza">

THE HAUNTED FIELDS
</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>
I know of fields by voices haunted still
</p>
<p class="i6">
That years ago grew hushed;
</p>
<p class="i6">
Whose buttercups are brushed
</p>
<p>
By feet that long have ceased to climb the hill.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
On whose green slopes the happy children play
</p>
<p class="i6">
As on a mother's lap,
</p>
<p class="i6">
Then steal through gate and gap,
</p>
<p>
And by strange hedge-rows make their wondering way.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Sometimes great seas of ripening corn they spy
</p>
<p class="i6">
Across whose rippling face
</p>
<p class="i6">
The shadowy billows race
</p>
<p>
And round the gate, forlornly whispering, die;
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Or in dark rutted lanes by weeds o'ergrown,
</p>
<p class="i6">
Round-eyed they watch a thrush
</p>
<p class="i6">
That breaks the noonday hush
</p>
<p>
Dashing with zest a snail against a stone;
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
At others, on an impulse waxing brave,
</p>
<p class="i6">
They climb the churchyard wall
</p>
<p class="i6">
And, marvelling at it all,
</p>
<p>
See strange black people gathered round a grave.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Then, without question, hurrying up the lane,
</p>
<p class="i6">
They seek once more their own&#8212;
</p>
<p class="i6">
That world in which is known
</p>
<p>
No fear of death, nor thought of change or pain.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Where still they call and answer, still they play,
</p>
<p class="i6">
And summer is ever there;
</p>
<p class="i6">
But I&#8212;I never dare
</p>
<p>
Pass through those fields, retrace the well-known way,
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Lest I might meet a lad whom once I knew,
</p>
<p class="i6">
Whose eyes accusingly

Should make demand of me:

<p>
&#34;Where are those dreams I left in charge with you?&#34;

CAPTIVE IN LONDON TOWN
</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>
There comes a ghostly space
</p>
<p class="i2">
'Twixt midnight and the dawn,
</p>
<p>
When from the heart of London Town
</p>
<p class="i2">
The tides of life are drawn.

</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
What time, when Spring is due,
</p>

The captives dungeoned deep

Beneath the stones of London Town

Grow troubled in their sleep,
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
And wake&#8212;mint, mallow, dock,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Brambles in bondage sore,
</p>
<p>
And grasses shut in London Town
</p>
<p class="i2">
A thousand years and more.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Yet though beneath the stones
</p>
<p class="i2">
They starve, and overhead
</p>
<p>
The countless feet pace London Town
</p>
<p class="i2">
Of men who hold them dead,
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Like Samson, blind and scorned,
</p>
<p class="i2">
In pain their time they bide
</p>
<p>
To seize the roots of London Town
</p>
<p class="i2">
And tumble down its pride.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Now well by proof and sign,
</p>
<p class="i2">
By men unheard, unseen,
</p>
<p>
They know that far from London Town
</p>
<p class="i2">
The woods once more are green.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
But theirs is still to wait,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Deaf to the myriad hum,
</p>
<p>
Beneath the stones of London Town
</p>
<p class="i2">
A Spring that needs must come.

THE GARDEN OF THE NIGHT
</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>
The Night is a far-spreading garden, and all through the hours
</p>
<p>
Glisten and glitter and sparkle her wonderful flowers.
</p>
<p>
First the great moon-rose full blooming; the great bed of stars
</p>
<p>
Touching with restful gold petals the woodland's dark bars;
</p>
<p>
Then arc-lights like asters that blossom in street and in square,
</p>
<p>
And lamps like primroses beyond them in planted parterre;
</p>
<p>
Great tulips of crimson that rise from the factory towers;
</p>
<p>
White lilies that drop from deep windows: all flowers, the Night's flowers!
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Blooms on the highway that twinkle and fade like the stars,
</p>
<p>
Golden and red on the vans and the carts and the cars;
</p>
<p>
Clusters of bloom in the village; lone homesteads a-light,
</p>
<p>
Decking the lawns of the darkness, the plots of the Night.
</p>
<p>
Then the bright blossoms of platform and signal that shine
</p>
<p>
By the iron-paved path of the garden&#8212;the lights of the Line;
</p>
<p>
The gold flowers of comfort and caution; the buds of dull red,
</p>
<p>
Sombre with warning; the green leaves that say &#34;Right ahead!&#34;
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Then the flowers in the harbour that low to the tide of it lean;
</p>
<p>
The lights on the port and the starboard, the red and the green,
</p>
<p>
Mixing and mingling with mast lights that move in the air,
</p>
<p>
And deck lights and wharf lights and lights upon pier-head and stair;
</p>
<p>
An edging of gold where a liner steals by like a thief;
</p>
<p>
The giant grey gleam of a searchlight that swings like a leaf;
</p>
<p>
And far out to seaward faint petals that flutter and fall
</p>
<p>
Against the white flower of the Lighthouse that gathers them all.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Then flower lights all golden with welcome&#8212;the lights of the inn;
</p>
<p>
And poisonous hell-flowers, lit doorways that beckon to sin;
</p>
<p>
Soft vesper flowers of the Churches with dark stems above;
</p>
<p>
Gold flowers of court and of cottage made one flower by love;
</p>
<p>
Beacons of windows on hillside and cliff to recall
</p>
<p>
Some wanderer lost for a season&#8212;Night's flowers one and all!
</p>
<p>
In the street, in the lane, on the Line, on the ships and the towers,
</p>
<p>
In the windows of cottage and palace&#8212;all flowers, the Night's flowers!

THE CROSSING SWORDS

As I lay dreaming in the grass

I saw a Knight of Tourney pass&#8212;

All conquering Summer. Twilit hours

<p>
Made soft light round him, rainbow flowers
</p>
<p class="i4">
Hung on his harness.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i8">
Down the dells
</p>
<p>
The fairy heralds rang blue-bells,
</p>
<p>
And even as they rocked and rang
</p>
<p>
Into the lists, full-armed, there sprang
</p>
<p>
Autumn, his helm the harvest moon,
</p>
<p>
His sword a sickle, the gleaner's tune
</p>
<p class="i8">
His hymn of battle.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i8">
Each bowed full low,
</p>
<p>
Knight to knight as to worthy foe,
</p>
<p>
Then Autumn tossed as his gauntlet down&#8212;
</p>
<p>
A leaf of the lime tree, golden brown&#8212;
</p>
<p>
And Summer bound it above the green
</p>
<p>
Of his shining breast-plate's verdant sheen.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
&#8212;They closed. Above them the driving mists
</p>
<p>
Stooped and feathered&#8212;and hid the lists.
</p>
<p>
Later the cloud mist rolled away
</p>
<p>
But dead in his harness the Green Knight lay.

LURES IMMORTAL
</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Sadly, apparently frustrate, life hangs above us,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Cruel, dark unexplained;
</p>
<p>
Yet still the immortal through mortal incessantly pierces
</p>
<p class="i2">
With calls, with appeals, and with lures.
</p>
<p>
Lure of the sinking sun, into undreamed islands,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Fortunate, far in the West;
</p>
<p>
Lure of the star, with speechless news o'er brimming,
</p>
<p class="i2">
With language of darted light;
</p>
<p>
Of the sea-glory of opening lids of Aurora,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Ushering eyes of the dawn;
</p>
<p>
Of the callow bird in the matin darkness calling,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Chorus of drowsy charm;
</p>
<p>
Of the wind, south-west, with whispering leaves illumined,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Solemn gold of the woods;
</p>
<p>
Of the intimate breeze of noon, deep-charged with a message,
</p>
<p class="i2">
How near, at times, unto speech!
</p>
<p>
Of the sea, that soul of a poet a-yearn for expression,
</p>
<p class="i2">
For ever yearning in vain!
</p>
<p>
Hoarse o'er the shingle with loud, unuttered meanings,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Hurling on caverns his heart.
</p>
<p>
Of the summer night, what to communicate, eager?
</p>
<p class="i2">
Perchance the secret of peace.
</p>
<p>
The lure of the silver to gold, of the pale unto colour,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Of the seen to the real unseen;
</p>
<p>
Of voices away to the voiceless, of sound unto silence,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Of words to a wordless calm;
</p>
<p>
Of music doomed unto wandering, still returning,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Ever to heaven and home.
</p>
<p>
The lure of the beautiful woman through flesh unto spirit,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Through a smile unto endless light;
</p>
<p>
Of the flight of a bird thro' evening over the marsh-land,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Lingering in Heaven alone;
</p>
<p>
Of the vessel disappearing over the sea-marge,
</p>
<p class="i2">
With him or with her that we love;
</p>
<p>
Of the sudden touch in the hand of a friend or a maiden,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Thrilling up to the stars.
</p>
<p>
The appealing death of a soldier, the moon just rising,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Kindling the battle-field;
</p>
<p>
Of the cup of water, refused by the thirsting Sidney,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Parched with the final pang:
</p>
<p>
Of the crucified Christ, yet lo, those arms extended,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Wide, as a world to embrace;
</p>
<p>
And last, and grandest, the lure, the invitation,
</p>
<p class="i2">
And sacred wooing of death;
</p>
<p>
Unto what regions, or heavens, or solemn spaces,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Who, but by dying, can tell?

GIOVANNI MALATESTA AT RIMINI
</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Giovanni Malatesta, the lame old man,
</p>
<p>
Walking one night, as he was used, being old,
</p>
<p>
Upon the grey seashore at Rimini,
</p>
<p>
And thinking dimly of those two whom love
</p>
<p>
Led to one death, and his less happy soul
</p>
<p>
For which Cain waited, heard a seagull scream,
</p>
<p>
Twice, like Francesca; for he struck but twice.
</p>
<p>
At that, rage thrust down pity; for it seemed
</p>
<p>
As if those windy bodies with the sea's
</p>
<p>
Unfriended heart within them for a voice
</p>
<p>
Had turned to mock him, and he called them friends,
</p>
<p>
And he had found a wild peace hearing them
</p>
<p>
Cry senseless cries, halloing to the wind.
</p>
<p>
He turned his back upon the sea; he saw
</p>
<p>
The ragged teeth of the sharp Apennines
</p>
<p>
Shut on the sea; his shadow in the moon
</p>
<p>
Ploughed up a furrow with an iron staff
</p>
<p>
In the hard sand, and thrust a long lean chin
</p>
<p>
Outward and downward, and thrust out a foot,
</p>
<p>
And leaned to follow after. As he saw
</p>
<p>
His crooked knee go forward under him
</p>
<p>
And after it the long straight iron staff,
</p>
<p>
&#34;The staff,&#34; he thought, &#34;is Paolo: like that staff
</p>
<p>
And like that knee we walked between the sun,
</p>
<p>
And her unmerciful eyes&#34;; and the old man,
</p>
<p>
Thinking of God, and how God ruled the world,
</p>
<p>
And gave to one man beauty for a snare
</p>
<p>
And a warped body to another man,
</p>
<p>
Not less than he in soul, not less than he
</p>
<p>
In hunger and capacity for joy,
</p>
<p>
Forgot Francesca's evil and his wrong,
</p>
<p>
His anger, his revenge, that memory,
</p>
<p>
Wondering at man's forgiveness of the old
</p>
<p>
Divine injustice, wondering at himself:
</p>
<p>
Giovanni Malatesta judging God.

Into the Limbo of the lost,
</p>
<p>
Into the Limbo of the others
</p>
<p>
Who wander crying and calling their mothers.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i8">
Now I know
</p>
<p>
The creatures that come to harry and raid
</p>
<p>
How they ride in the airy regions,
</p>
<p>
Dance their rounds on meadow and moor,
</p>
<p>
Gallop under the earth in legions,
</p>
<p>
Hunt and holloa and run their races
</p>
<p>
Over tombs in burial-places.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
In the common roads where people go,
</p>
<p>
Masked and mingled with human traces,
</p>
<p>
I have marked, I who know,
</p>
<p>
In the common dust a devil's spoor.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i8">
To somebody's gate
</p>
<p>
A Thing is footing it, cares not much
</p>
<p>
Whether he creep through an Emperor's portal
</p>
<p>
And steal the fate
</p>
<p>
Of a Prince, or into a poor man's hutch&#8212;
</p>
<p>
For the grief will be everywhere as great
</p>
<p>
And he'll everywhere spread the smirch of sin&#8212;
</p>
<p>
So long as a taste of our blood he may win,
</p>
<p>
So long as he may become a mortal.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i8">
I beseech you,
</p>
<p>
Prince and poor man, to watch the gate.
</p>
<p>
The heart is poisoned where he has fed,
</p>
<p>
The house is ruined that lets him in.
</p>
<p>
Yet I know I shall never teach you.
</p>
<p>
With the voice of the dear and the eyes of the dead
</p>
<p>
He will come to the door, and you'll let him in.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i8">
If I could forget
</p>
<p>
Only that ever I had a child,
</p>
<p>
If only upon some mirk midnight,
</p>
<p>
When he stands at the door, all wet and wild,
</p>
<p>
With his owl's feather and dripping hair,
</p>
<p class="i4">
I could lie warm and not care,
</p>
<p>
I should rid myself of this Changeling yet.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
I carried my woe to the Wise Man yonder,
</p>
<p>
&#34;You sell forgetfulness, they say.
</p>
<p class="i8">
How much to pay
</p>
<p>
To forget a son who is my sorrow?&#34;
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
The Wise Man began to ponder.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Charms have I, many a one,
</p>
<p>
To make a woman forget her lover,
</p>
<p>
A man his wife or a fortune fled,
</p>
<p>
To make the day forget the morrow,
</p>
<p>
The doer forget the deed he has done,
</p>
<p>
But a mighty spell must I borrow
</p>
<p>
To make a woman forget her son,
</p>
<p>
For this I will take a royal fee.
</p>
<p class="i8">
Your house,&#34; said he,
</p>
<p>
&#34;The storied hangings richly cover,
</p>
<p>
On your banquet table there were six
</p>
<p>
Golden branched candlesticks,
</p>
<p class="i4">
And of noble dishes you had a score.
</p>
<p class="i8">
The crown you wore
</p>
<p>
I remember, the sparkling crown.
</p>
<p class="i8">
All of these,
</p>
<p>
Madam, you shall pay me down.
</p>
<p>
Also the day I give you ease
</p>
<p>
Of golden guineas you pay a hundred.&#34;
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Laughing I left the Wise Man's door.
</p>
<p>
Has he found such things where a Changeling sits?
</p>
<p>
The home is darkened from roof to floor,
</p>
<p>
The house is naked and ravaged and plundered
</p>
<p class="i8">
Where a Changling sits
</p>
<p>
On the hearthstone, warming his shivering fits.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
He sits at his ease, for he knows well
</p>
<p class="i8">
He can keep his post.
</p>
<p>
He has left me nothing to pay the cost
</p>
<p>
Of snatching my heart from his private Hell.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Yet when all is done and told
</p>
<p>
I am glad the Wise Man in the City
</p>
<p class="i8">
Had no pity
</p>
<p>
For me, and for him I had no gold.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Because if I did not remember him,
</p>
<p>
My little child&#8212;Ah! What should we have,
</p>
<p>
He and I? Not even a grave
</p>
<p>
With a name of his own by the river's brim.
</p>
<p>
Because if among the poppies gay,
</p>
<p>
On the hill-side, now my eyes are dim,
</p>
<p>
I could not fancy a child at play,
</p>
<p>
And if I should pass by the pool in the quarry
</p>
<p>
And never see him, a darling ghost,
</p>
<p>
Sailing a boat there, I should be sorry&#8212;
</p>
<p>
If in the firelit, lone December
</p>
<p>
I never heard him come scampering post
</p>
<p>
Haste down the stair&#8212;if the soul that is lost
</p>
<p>
Came back, and I did not remember.
